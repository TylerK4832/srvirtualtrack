# srvirtualtrack

SRVirtualTrack is a web application built to provide a way for runners to log races and compete against one another on a virtual leaderboard.
This web app was developed in response to the cancellation of many high school sports, including track and field, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
SRVirtualTrack is written with the Flask micro web framework and with frontend elements from Bootstrap. It is hosted with Heroku.
